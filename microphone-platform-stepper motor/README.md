Data converter Microphone-Platform-Stepper motor 28BYJ
=

According to the technical specifications, it is necessary to transmit information about exceeding the sound threshold from the microphone to the microcontroller device, process it, and then transmit it to the 28BYJ stepper motor controller. It should be noted that the rotation of the stepper motor in the event of detection of a repeated excess of the sound level should continue without interruption from the rotation from the moment of the first detection of motion.
Components:

-Arduino platform
  
-Microphone*1

-Stepper motor 28BYJ *1
