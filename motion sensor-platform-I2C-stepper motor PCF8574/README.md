Data converter Motion sensor-Platform-I2C-Stepper motor PCF8574
=

According to the technical specifications, it is necessary to transmit information from the HC-SR501 motion sensor to the microcontroller device, process it, and then transmit it through the PCF8574 I2C expander to the 28BYJ stepper motor controller. It should be noted that the rotation of the stepper motor in the event of detection of repeated movement should continue without interruption from the rotation from the moment of the first detection of movement.

Components:

-Arduino platform
  
-Motion sensor PIR HC-SR501*1

-Expander PCF8574 I2C*1
