=

According to the technical specifications, it is necessary to organize the transfer of an analog value from the Hall sensor to the Arduino Uno platform, process the information, convert the analog value of the Hall sensor to Gauss and output it via the SPI interface of the MAX7219 to the segment indicator.

Circuit components:

-Hall Sensor KY-024 *1

-Arduino platform

-MAX7219 *1

-LED GNQ-5641AS-21
