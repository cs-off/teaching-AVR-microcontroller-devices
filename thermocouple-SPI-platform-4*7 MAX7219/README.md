  According to the technical specifications, it is necessary to organize the transmission of an analog value from the thermocouple signal converter to the Arduino Uno platform, process the information, and rotate the stepper motor proportionally to the received value.
  The operating principle of clock-type indicators is based on the conversion of small measured deviations into large ones that are convenient for human perception. For this, gear, spring or electronic transmission devices are used.
According to the technical specifications, the rotation of the stepper motor should replace the gear mechanism in the clock-type indicator. The deviation of the arrow should indicate the current temperature.
